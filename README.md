The Energy Trade Tracking Platform is still in progress.

1. This web application was in the development stage and used the Django framework, HTML, CSS, Js, AJAX for the front end, and PostgreSQL to store data.
2. This project was previously developed in PHP, but my motive was to build it in Django, and it makes me want to develop this web application.
        
Features of this project or web application:
    
1. User login: Users have to login via username and password.
2. User Registration: Only admins have the authority or permission to create users.
3. Reset Password: The user can reset their passwords by entering their email address and receiving a follow-up email to the respective email address, which is an in-built Django function.

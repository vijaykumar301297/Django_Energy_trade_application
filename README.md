Energy Trade Tracking Platform and still in progress.

    This website was developed using the Django framework, HTML, CSS, Js, AJAX for the front end, and PostgreSQL to store data.
    This project was developed in PHP, but my motive was to build it in Django. I am working day by day to make progress.
    
    Features of this project or web application:
    
    1. User login - Users have lo login via username and password.
    2. User Registration - only admins have the authority or permission to create users.
    3. Reset Password - User can reset their passwords by entering their email address and receiving a follow-up email to the respective email if, which is an inbuild django function.
